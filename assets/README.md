## 📚 Amit's Library Tracker

A simple, interactive web app to track your reading progress across multiple books. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it displays book details in a table format and uses progress bars to visualize how much of each book you've read.

### ✨ Features

- Add, edit, and delete books
- Visual progress bars for each book
- Highlights books that are “over-read” (read pages > total pages)
- Strikes through titles of over-read books for clarity
- Clean UI with responsive styling
